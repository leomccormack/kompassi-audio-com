The Kompassi rendering plugin serves as a demonstration of the spatial audio encoder and decoder developed by Dr. Leo McCormack and Prof. Archontis Politis. The internal algorithms are based on research conducted during their PhDs, which centered around the Coding and Multi-Parameterisation of Ambisonic Sound Scenes (COMPASS) method.
